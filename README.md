# STAT-724
This repository serves as a back up to my local directory, which has the files for my STAT-724: Intro to Data Science course. This course taught me a range of machine learning topics ranging from Logistic Regression, to 
topics in Unsupervised Learning. You can view my final [project](https://github.com/Lupercio421/STAT-724/blob/master/Final_Project/STAT724_Daniel_Lupercio_exam.pdf) and the Python [code](https://github.com/Lupercio421/STAT-724/blob/master/Final_Project/STAT724_Lupercio_Daniel_python_code.ipynb) used to produce the models.
